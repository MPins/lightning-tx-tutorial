    "# Creating the First Commitment Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll create the First Commitment transaction of a Lightning Channel from scratch in python. We'll go through each part of the transaction, how it's constructed, signed, and the message the peers exchange to send and get the needed information from each other to make it happen. We'll test it using bitcoin core in regtest mode.\n",

    "### Creating the Commitment Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the funding transaction was not published yet, as without the commitment transaction signed by Bob, Alice would have to trust Bob to get back her funds from the multisig UTXO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start creating Alice unsigned commitment transaction. What makes a transaction 'unsigned' is that the witness field is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Commitment Number\n",
    "To more easily allow both sides to keep track of the commitment numbers, each commitment actually encodes the number of the commitment within the lock time and sequence fields of the commitment transaction. Within the protocol, this special encoding is referred to as **state hints**. Assuming a party knows the current commitment number, they’re able to use the state hints to easily recognize if a broadcasted commitment was a revoked one. Rather than encode the state hint in plain sight, an obfuscated state hint is used in its place. This obfuscation is achieved by first XORing the current commitment number with a set of random bytes generated deterministically using the funding public keys of both sides of the channel. A total of 6 bytes (48 bits) across the lock time and sequence (24 bits of the locktime and 24 bits of the sequence) are used to encode the state hint within the commitment transaction, so 6 random bytes are needed to use for XORing. To obtain these 6 bytes, both sides obtain the SHA-256 hash of the initiator’s funding key concatenated to the responder’s funding key."

    "**anchor outputs** exists to prevent a malicious peer from attaching child transactions with a low fee density to an anchor and thereby blocking the victim from getting the commit tx confirmed in time. This defense is supported by a change in Bitcoin core 0.19: [bitcoin/bitcoin#15681](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681). This is also the reason that every non-anchor output on the commit tx is CSV locked. The feature is optional and can be enabled if both peers in a channel support it. But [Eclair v0.11.0](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair/blob/master/docs/release-notes/eclair-v0.11.0.md) stop accepting channels that don't support anchor outputs."
