    "# Creating Commitment Transactions with HTLC in Transit\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll create the Commitment Transactions with HTLC in transit from scratch using Python. We'll break down each part of the transaction, explain how it's constructed and signed, and detail the messages exchanged between peers to share the necessary information. Finally, we'll test everything using Bitcoin Core in regtest mode.\n",
