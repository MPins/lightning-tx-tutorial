    "\n",
    "The HTLC-Timeout and HTLC-Success Transactions are almost identical, except the HTLC-timeout transaction is timelocked. Both HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success transactions can be spent by a valid penalty transaction.\n",

    "* version: 2\n",
    "* locktime: 0 for HTLC-success, cltv_expiry for HTLC-timeout\n",
    "* txin count: 1\n",
    "    * txin[0] outpoint: txid of the commitment transaction and output_index of the matching HTLC output for the HTLC transaction\n",
    "    * txin[0] sequence: 0 (set to 1 for option_anchors)\n",
    "    * txin[0] script bytes: 0\n",
    "    * txin[0] witness stack: 0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig>  <payment_preimage> for HTLC-success, 0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig> <> for HTLC-timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "* txout count: 1\n",
    "    * txout[0] amount: the HTLC amount_msat divided by 1000 (rounding down) minus fees in satoshis (see Fee Calculation)\n",
    "    * txout[0] script: version-0 P2WSH with witness script as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "if option_anchors applies to this commitment transaction, SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY is used as described in [BOLT #5](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/05-onchain.md#generation-of-htlc-transactions)\n"
