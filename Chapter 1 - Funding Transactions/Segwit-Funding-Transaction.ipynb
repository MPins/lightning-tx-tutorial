    "# Creating a Funding Transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll create a Lightning Channel funding transaction from scratch in python. We'll go through each part of the transaction, how it's constructed, signed, and the message the peers exchange to send and get the needed information from each other to make it happen. We'll test it using bitcoin core in regtest mode.\n",

    "## Prerequisite knowledge\n",
    "- For all notebooks:\n",
    "    - A high level understanding of the bitcoin. e.g. [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos UTXO model, in particular [Chapter 6](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc).\n",
    "    - A high level understanding of the Lightning Network. e.g. [Mastering Lightning](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) TODO Get the chapter to point it here\n",
